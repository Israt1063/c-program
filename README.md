# C Programming Practice

## 📚 About This Repository
This repository contains a collection of C programs that I have written to practice various concepts in C programming. It includes fundamental topics such as arithmetic operations, geometric calculations, and basic algorithms.


## 📂 Folder Structure
- Basic_Arithmetic_Operations/
  ➔ Programs for basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- Geometric_Calculations/ 
  ➔ Programs for calculating areas, perimeters, and volumes of different geometric shapes.

- Conversions/
  ➔ Programs that convert units like Celsius to Fahrenheit, kilometers to miles, etc.

- Interest_Calculations/ 
  ➔ Programs to calculate Simple Interest and Compound Interest.

- Algorithms/
  ➔ Programs that demonstrate basic algorithms such as sorting, searching, and matrix manipulations.



## 🔧 Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any C compiler
- VS Code
- Git and GitHub


## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/Israt1063/C-Programming-Practice.git
    
2. Navigate into any folder.
3. Compile the C program using GCC:
    bash
    gcc filename.c -o output
    ./output
    

## ✨ Future Plans
- Add more advanced algorithms and data structures (like linked lists, stacks, etc.).
- Optimize and refactor some programs for better performance and readability.
- Add solutions to competitive programming problems in C.
